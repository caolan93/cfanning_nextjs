					<p>
						While obtaining my Mathematical Science Degree from T.U.D I attended
						a computer programming module which based around the programming
						language of C++ in my 2nd year of study. <br />
						The module quickly became my favourite lecture in college, but, upon
						completing the year and progressing into the 3rd year of my course I
						was given the disheartening news that the Computer Programming
						module had been removed from my course as not enough students had
						opted to attend the class.
						<br />
						<br />
						After completing my degree in 2020 in conjunction with the Covid-19
						outbreak I found myself with a lot more free time than I was
						expecting with the heavy restrictions both nationally and
						internationally.
						<br />I then made the decision to put my free time to good use and
						took it upon myself to make an effort to get back into programming!

						From reading online, I gathered that a really good place to start as
						a self-taught programming would be with the technologies at the core
						of every web application you visit in your day to day life.
						<br /> These, of course, were the technologies HTML, CSS and
						JavaScript! I found myself learning through a wide variety of
						resources online which ranged from interactive learning websites and
						videos to reading public forums. <br /> Though I found myself
						learning through many different avenues, of course I had my
						favourite avenues of teaching... I feel obligated to share my
						personal favourites as they have helped me so much both on an
						individual basis and collectively in my pursuit to become a
						professional software engineer! <br /> The websites that I found
						helped me the most are; Freecodecamp, Youtube, Udemy and
						Stackoverflow.

						On an individual level the online teaches both through their free to
						view videos on Youtube and through some paid courses via their own
						personal websites or Udemy are: DevelopedByEd, TravesityMedia, Sonny
						Sanga, JavaScriptMastery and Anna Konga. <br /> I feel it would be
						ungrateful of me not to mention these creators on an individual
						level as they have helped me (and thousands of others) to reach a
						dream to become a programmer. I have a great passion for learning
						and building projects. I'm focused, driven and I would love an
						opportunity to learn and grow not just as a developer but as a
						person.

						Thanks for reading!
