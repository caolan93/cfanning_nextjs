				<p>
					While obtaining my Mathematical Science Degree from T.U.D I attended a
					computer programming module which based around the programming
					language of C++ in my 2nd year of study. <br />
					The module quickly became my favourite lecture in college, but, upon
					completing the year and progressing into the 3rd year of my course I
					was given the disheartening news that the Computer Programming module
					had been removed from my course as not enough students had opted to
					attend the class.
					<br />
					<br />
					After completing my degree in 2020 in conjunction with the Covid-19
					outbreak I found myself with a lot more free time than I was expecting
					with the heavy restrictions both nationally and internationally.
					<br />I then made the decision to put my free time to good use and
					took it upon myself to make an effort to get back into programming!
					<br /> <br />
					From reading online, I gathered that a really good place to start as a
					self-taught programming would be with the technologies at the core of
					every web application you visit in your day to day life.
					<br /> These, of course, were the technologies HTML, CSS and
					JavaScript! I found myself learning through a wide variety of
					resources online which ranged from interactive learning websites and
					videos to reading public forums. <br /> Though I found myself learning
					through many different avenues, of course I had my favourite avenues
					of teaching... I feel obligated to share my personal favourites as
					they have helped me so much both on an individual basis and
					collectively in my pursuit to become a professional software engineer!{" "}
					<br /> The websites that I found helped me the most are; Freecodecamp,
					Youtube, Udemy and Stackoverflow.
					<br />
					<br />
					On an individual level the online teaches both through their free to
					view videos on Youtube and through some paid courses via their own
					personal websites or Udemy are: DevelopedByEd, TravesityMedia, Sonny
					Sanga, JavaScriptMastery and Anna Konga. <br /> I feel it would be
					ungrateful of me not to mention these creators on an individual level
					as they have helped me (and thousands of others) to reach a dream to
					become a programmer. I have a great passion for learning and building
					projects. I'm focused, driven and I would love an opportunity to learn
					and grow not just as a developer but as a person.
					<br />
					<br />
					Thanks for reading!
					<br /> Yours Sincerely, <br /> Caolan.
